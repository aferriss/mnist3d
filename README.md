A 3d visualization of the first 2500 mnist digits. 

The visualization is based on a 3d t-SNE vis by Lauens van der Maaten and can be found here:

The mnist xyz digit positions are stored in text files in the data folders. Those positions were generated using code from:
https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/code/tsne_python.zip

You'll have to generate the number textures yourself. I've made a (messy) utility to do so located
